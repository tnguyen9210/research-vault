## [2026-08-19] update | Document Fitted Q-Iteration; group the FQI family under concepts/fqi/

- Created `concepts/fqi/fitted-q-iteration.md` — the base template the vault referenced everywhere but never defined: Bellman relabelling + least-squares refit, the ADP view $Q_{k+1}\approx\Pi_\mathcal{F}\mathcal{T}Q_k$ and why $\Pi_\mathcal{F}\mathcal{T}$ need not contract (hence Bellman completeness, not just [[realizability]]), the backward reward-propagation intuition, a worked 3-transition example, the offline extrapolation failure mode, and the statistical / approximation / coverage error decomposition
- **Structural change: `concepts/` may now contain topical subfolders.** Created `concepts/fqi/` and moved four pages into it: `fitted-q-iteration`, `deep-q-network`, `implicit-q-learning`, `pessimistic-fitted-q-learning` — i.e. the template and the things that ARE FQI instantiations. General primitives (`expectile-regression`, `overestimation-bias`, `pessimism-principle`, `softmax-bellman-operator`) stayed flat because other clusters reference them too.
- Wikilinks are unaffected: Obsidian resolves `[[slug]]` by filename, not path, and the move introduced no new basename collisions. Verified 0 broken links after the move.
- Updated `CLAUDE.md`: subfolder entry in the directory layout, a naming-table row, and a "Concept subfolders" rule block (links stay `[[slug]]` and never include the folder; filenames unique vault-wide; create a subfolder only at 4+ pages with a clear parent page; anything walking the wiki must recurse).
- Cross-linked the new page from `pessimistic-fitted-q-learning`, `implicit-q-learning`, `deep-q-network`, `pessimism-principle`, `overestimation-bias`, `expectile-regression`, and `topics/offline-reinforcement-learning` — the last now frames the field as "FQI with one of its three steps modified" (target / regression / policy extraction), with a table of instances on the FQI page
- Updated `index.md`: +1 entry, plus a note under Concepts that FQI-family pages live in `concepts/fqi/`
- Noted for a future lint: `best-arm-identification`, `monte-carlo-tree-search`, and `test-time-scaling` each exist as BOTH a concept and a topic page, so `[[slug]]` for those three is already ambiguous in Obsidian. Pre-existing, unrelated to this change.

## [2026-08-19] ingest | Epsilon-First Policies for Budget-Limited Multi-Armed Bandits (AAAI 2010)

- Renamed raw `1817-8271-1-PB.pdf` -> `TranThanh2010Epsilon.pdf`
- Replaced the `papers/TranThanh2010Epsilon.md` STUB (created in the 2026-08-19 lint pass) with a full page written from the source
- Created concept page: `epsilon-first`
- Created author pages: `Chapman-Archie`, `Munoz-de-Cote-Enrique`; added the 2010 paper to `Tran-Thanh-Long`, `Rogers-Alex`, `Jennings-Nicholas-R`
- **ATTRIBUTION CORRECTION.** The vault credited [[TranThanh2012Knapsack]] with introducing the [[budget-limited-mab]] and its unbounded-knapsack characterization. The source shows both are from the 2010 paper ("we introduce a new version of the MAB, a budget-limited MAB with an overall budget"; "a MAB with an overall budget limit reduces to an unbounded knapsack problem"), along with the reward-density statistic and the density-ordered greedy step. Fixed in: `concepts/budget-limited-mab.md` (`introduced_by` and body), `papers/TranThanh2012Knapsack.md` (TL;DR, Problem, Connections), `topics/budget-limited-bandits.md`, `index.md`, `overview.md`. 2012's contributions -- [[kube]], fractional KUBE, $O(\ln B)$, matching lower bound -- are unchanged.
- **Precision fix.** The $O(B^{2/3})$ rate is NOT stated in the 2010 paper. Corollary 2 gives $L \le 2\varepsilon B D_{\max} + 2B\sqrt{(-\ln\delta)\sum_j c_j/(\varepsilon B)}$ w.p. $(1-\delta)^k$; optimizing over $\varepsilon$ yields $\varepsilon^* \propto B^{-1/3}$ and hence $B^{2/3}$. That optimization, and the "provably stuck" claim, are [[TranThanh2012Knapsack]]'s. Noted on both paper pages and on `concepts/kube.md`.
- Updated `concepts/upper-confidence-bound.md`: the 2010 paper uses UCB as an exploration subroutine and finds it no better than uniform -- evidence that the $B^{2/3}$ ceiling is caused by the phase split, not the sampling rule
- Updated `overview.md`: budget-limited paragraph re-attributed; sources 13 -> 14
- Updated `index.md`: +3 entries (1 concept, 2 authors), 2 entries corrected, stub description replaced
- No outstanding stubs remain in the vault.

## [2026-08-19] lint | Vault-wide link repair: 0 broken links, 0 orphans

- Scanned all 84 wiki pages for unresolved `[[links]]`, stubs, and pages with no inbound links. Scanner now strips code spans first -- `[[slug]]` in index.md and `[[links]]` in log.md are documentation text inside backticks, not real links, and were previously false positives.
- **Broken links fixed (8 targets, 6 new pages):**
  - `authors/Carin-Lawrence.md` -- third author of [[Song2019Revisiting]], omitted at ingest
  - `concepts/pessimism-principle.md` -- referenced from `importance-weighting`; now the hub for the offline LCB idea across [[Ryu2025Improved]], [[Yin2023Offline]], PEVI, CQL
  - `concepts/upper-confidence-bound.md` -- referenced from `kube`, `budget-limited-mab`, [[TranThanh2012Knapsack]]
  - `concepts/eluder-dimension.md` -- referenced from `doec`
  - `concepts/epsilon-sec.md` -- referenced from `doec`, [[Qin2026Taming]], `topics/offline-oracle-efficient-bandits`; written from the source PDF (Definition 3, Theorem 3, Propositions 1 and 3)
  - `papers/TranThanh2010Epsilon.md` -- STUB, clearly banner-marked: no PDF in `raw/papers/`, content sourced only from what [[TranThanh2012Knapsack]] states about its predecessor
- **Orphans fixed (6 pages, 0 new content):** [[Foster2025Foundation]] now links [[spanner-sampling]], its authors [[Mhammedi-Zakaria]] / [[Rohatgi-Dhruv]], and the saved query [[2026-06-16-foster2025-sections-1-4]]; [[Ryu2025Improved]] now links [[Ryu-J-Jon]] and [[Jun-Kwang-Sung]]. All were reachable only from `index.md`.
- **Garbled index entries fixed:** the `test-time-scaling` concept line had `offline-regression-oracle`'s description appended to it, and the `test-time-scaling` topic line had a duplicated `FALCON -> OE2D` tail. Both truncated to their correct text; the orphaned tail restored to the `offline-regression-oracle` entry where it belonged.
- Updated `index.md`: +6 entries (1 paper stub, 4 concepts, 1 author)
- **Result: 0 broken links, 0 orphans across 84 pages.**
- Outstanding: [[TranThanh2010Epsilon]] needs a real ingest (AAAI 2010) to replace the stub.

## [2026-08-19] ingest | Offline RL with Differentiable Function Approximation is Provably Efficient (ICLR 2023)

- Renamed raw `2210.00750v2.pdf` -> `Yin2023Offline.pdf`
- Venue verified as ICLR 2023 via Yu-Xiang Wang's NSF project page (arXiv abs page carries no venue comment); slug uses venue year per the `Song2019Revisiting` precedent
- Created `wiki/papers/Yin2023Offline.md`
- Created concept pages: `differentiable-function-approximation`, `pessimistic-fitted-q-learning`, `instance-dependent-bounds` (the last is a HUB page, not novel to this paper -- created by request to serve the vault's dominant guarantee type)
- Created author pages: `Yin-Ming`, `Wang-Mengdi`, `Wang-Yu-Xiang`
- Updated `topics/offline-reinforcement-learning.md`: theory/practice axis, PFQL entry, 5 new open problems
- Updated concepts: `realizability` (Bellman completeness), `coverage-coefficient` (concentrability + uniform coverage), `importance-weighting`, `best-arm-identification`
- Updated papers: `Kostrikov2022Offline` (theory counterpart), `Ryu2025Improved` (shared pessimism principle)
- Updated `overview.md`: theory-of-offline-RL paragraph, two new threads (instance-dependent guarantees cross-cutting; theory/practice gap), sources 12 -> 13
- Updated `index.md`: +7 entries (1 paper, 3 concepts, 3 authors)
- Critiques recorded on the paper page: uniform coverage (Asmp 2.3) requires parameter identifiability and so excludes overparameterized nets, contradicting the "$\theta$ = network weights" motivation; rate carries $d$ = parameter count, not $\sqrt{d}$; "provably efficient" is statistical only -- the fitted-Q step is a nonconvex argmin analyzed as exactly solved
- Noted for lint: `[[pessimism-principle]]` referenced from `concepts/importance-weighting.md` does not exist (stub to create)

## [2026-08-19] ingest | Offline Reinforcement Learning with Implicit Q-Learning (ICLR 2022)

- Renamed raw `2110.06169v1.pdf` -> `Kostrikov2022Offline.pdf`
- Created `wiki/papers/Kostrikov2022Offline.md` (framing: theory gap + smooth-aggregator thread, per discussion)
- Created concept pages: `expectile-regression`, `implicit-q-learning` (AWR and in-sample-learning considered and deferred)
- Created author pages: `Kostrikov-Ilya`, `Nair-Ashvin`, `Levine-Sergey`
- Created topic page: `topics/offline-reinforcement-learning.md` — first offline RL topic in the vault
- Updated concepts: `overestimation-bias`, `softmax-bellman-operator`, `deep-q-network`, `power-mean-mcts`, `coverage-coefficient`
- Updated papers: `Song2019Revisiting`, `Dam2024Power` (thematic parallels); `topics/monte-carlo-tree-search` (related topics)
- Updated `overview.md`: offline RL paragraph, new cross-cutting thread "smooth aggregators in place of max" (Dam2024Power / Song2019Revisiting / Kostrikov2022Offline), sources 11 -> 12
- Updated `index.md`: +7 entries (1 paper, 2 concepts, 3 authors, 1 topic)
- Headline open question recorded: no finite-$\tau$ bound on $\max_{a:\pi_\beta(a|s)>0} Q^*(s,a) - V_\tau(s)$; conjecture that the gap is governed by a density-weighted coverage quantity ([[coverage-coefficient]]) rather than a support indicator
- Noted for lint: pre-existing broken link `[[Carin-Lawrence]]` in `Song2019Revisiting.md`; garbled tail text in two `index.md` entries (`test-time-scaling` concept and topic lines)

## [2026-06-09] update | KUBE vs. fractional KUBE comparison

- Added "## KUBE vs. Fractional KUBE" section to `concepts/kube.md`: same objective, per-step knapsack-solver fork (greedy multiset + sampling vs. fractional relaxation = UCB-on-densities), side-by-side table, and the bound-vs-practice inversion (fractional has tighter bound but KUBE wins ≤40% under diverse costs).
- Trimmed the now-redundant Fractional-KUBE bullet in "Variants" to a pointer to the new section.
- No new pages or links; no other files touched.
