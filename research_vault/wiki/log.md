## [2026-06-16] ingest | Is a Good Foundation Necessary for Efficient RL? (arXiv 2025)

- Renamed raw `2503.07453v2.pdf` → `Foster2025Foundation.pdf`

- Updated `index.md`: +7 entries (1 paper, 3 concepts, 3 authors)
- New thread: computational-statistical tradeoffs for LM alignment via sampling oracle. Stubs referenced: XPO (Xie et al. 2024), OnlineDPO (Guo et al. 2024)

## [2026-06-09] update | Song2019Revisiting — add Assumptions & Theorems section

- Added "## Assumptions & Theorems" to `wiki/papers/Song2019Revisiting.md`: vocabulary, Lemma 2, Theorem 3, Theorem 4 (all three parts), gradient noise argument, and a how-the-pieces-fit diagram — all in plain language with the honest-gap note.

## [2026-06-09] update | KUBE vs. fractional KUBE comparison

- Added "## KUBE vs. Fractional KUBE" section to `concepts/kube.md`: same objective, per-step knapsack-solver fork (greedy multiset + sampling vs. fractional relaxation = UCB-on-densities), side-by-side table, and the bound-vs-practice inversion (fractional has tighter bound but KUBE wins ≤40% under diverse costs).
- Trimmed the now-redundant Fractional-KUBE bullet in "Variants" to a pointer to the new section.
- No new pages or links; no other files touched.

- Updated index.md (7 new entries)
- New thread: first budget-limited/cost-bandit family in the vault. Stubs referenced but not created: [[TranThanh2010Epsilon]] (the ε-first predecessor), [[upper-confidence-bound]]
